## Explanation of app
Sign up with an E-mail address and Password (**PLEASE DO NOT USE YOUR REAL PASSWORD FOR SECURITY REASONS**) and sign in to enter the cyberpunk streets of Tic-Tac-BRO! You and a friend get to choose your **Bro**. **X**, a pink kawaii deer that may seem innocent but can be just as tough! Or **O**, a street punk rat you don't want to cheese off! X will always go first so keep that in mind while choosing X or O.  Once you click "New Game" the game board will show, think of it as a map to the streets, It will be your job to try to take 3 territories (spaces) in a row first to be declared winner. It can be diagonal, horizontal, or vertical. Once there is a winner the game will stop and putting an X or O on a space will be unavailable. If all the spaces are filled and there is no winner then the game will declare a **CAT** which in other words means a tie.  Want to play again? Awesome! just click "New Game" to try again! The board will clear and X will start again. When done playing you can sign out and sign in the next day for more fun!
